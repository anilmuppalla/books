## Responsibility
  - Use your own ethics and judgement to make a call on accepting new responsibilities, you have the right to say no to situations with great risks.
  - Take responsibility for yourself and your actions with respect to your career, projects. 
  - In addition to doing your personal best, you must analyze the situation for risks beyond your control.
  - Do not be afraid to admit ignorance or error. When you make a mistake offer options and not blame/ lame excuses.
  - Rubber duck before you have a crucial conversation, whether it is scoping a project or giving/ receiving feedback.

## Entropy
  - There are many factors that cause Entropy/ Software rot, the most important one is pyschology/ culture of the team.
  - The broken window theory
    - One broken window unrepaired instills a sense of abandonement. Neglect accelerated rot faster than any other factor.
    - Do not leave broken windows (bad designs, wrong decisions, poor code) unrepaired. Fix them as they are discovered.
    - If you cannot fix it immediately, set aside a dedicated time for clean up, similar to spring home cleaning.
